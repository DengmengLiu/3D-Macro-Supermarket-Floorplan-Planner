## Getting Started

When you first launch the application, you'll be prompted to create a new floor plan. This is your canvas for designing the supermarket layout.

## Camera Controls

Navigate through your supermarket design using these camera controls:

| Action | Control |
|--------|---------|
| Move Camera | **WASD** or **Arrow Keys** |
| Rotate Camera | **Q** (counter-clockwise) and **E** (clockwise) |
| Zoom In/Out | **Mouse Scroll Wheel** |

**Note**: Camera movements will be smooth with acceleration and deceleration. The camera is also restricted to stay within the boundaries of your floor plan.

## Creating the Floor

1. When you start the application, you'll see a floor creation panel
2. Enter the width and length of your supermarket floor in meters
3. Click "Create Floor" to generate the floor and surrounding walls
4. The camera will automatically position to give you a good view of the entire floor

## Component Placement

### Selecting Components

1. Open the side menu by clicking the tab on the left side of the screen
2. Browse through available components organized by categories:
   - Shelves
   - Fridges
   - Checkouts
   - Walls
   - Other components

### Placing Components

1. Click on a component in the menu to select it
2. Move your mouse over the floor to see a preview of the component
3. The preview will show green when placement is valid or red when invalid
4. **Left-click** to place the component
5. Hold **Shift + Left-click** to place multiple copies of the same component
6. Press **R** to rotate the component before placing
7. **Right-click** or press **Escape** to cancel placement

### Modifying Placed Components

- Click on a placed component to select it
- Use the **Mouse** to move and **R** for rotate the selected component
- Press **Right-click** to remove the selected component

## Grid Controls

The grid helps you align components precisely:

1. Access grid settings in the Settings tab of the side menu
2. Toggle grid visibility on/off
3. Adjust grid cell size using the slider (from 0.1m to 10m)
4. Toggle "Snap to Grid" to enable/disable automatic alignment to grid lines

## Unique Features

### Top-Down View Toggle

The planner includes a convenient top-down view toggle that helps you see your layout from a bird's-eye perspective:

1. Click the **View Toggle** button in the top-right corner of the screen
2. The camera will smoothly transition between the perspective view and top-down view
3. Use top-down view for precise placement and overall layout planning
4. Return to perspective view for a more realistic visualization of your store

### Adjustable Grid Density

Fine-tune your layout precision with the adjustable grid system:

1. Use the **+** and **-** keys to quickly increase or decrease grid density
2. Choose from preset grid sizes (small, medium, large) in the Settings panel
3. Finer grids (higher density) allow for more precise component placement
4. Coarser grids (lower density) are better for rapid layout creation

### Zone Mapping System

Organize your store layout with color-coded zones:

1. Access the **Zones** tab in the side menu
2. Create zones by selecting a zone type and drawing on the floor
3. Customize zone colors and names to represent different store areas (Produce, Dairy, etc.)
4. Toggle zone visibility to focus on different aspects of your layout
5. Use zones to visualize traffic flow and ensure optimal product placement
